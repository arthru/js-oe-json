You are in the::

   full-oe-lib branch

And this is an actual comment on this implementation.

- dependant from openerp-web library paths
- using the magic ``web/webclient/js`` to get full js libs
- using jquery
- provided javascript ``main.js`` is 23 lines long.
- provided HTML ``index.html`` is 42 lines long.


If you want to make this implementation work, you'll have to change hard written values
in ``index.html`` in the javascript ``<script>`` element.
